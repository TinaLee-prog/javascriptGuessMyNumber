# javascriptProject_GuessMyNumber

This is a beginner-level JavaScript game project where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 to 20. 
The project demonstrates my ability to connect JavaScript logic with dynamic UI updates, manage application state, and provide interactive feedback through DOM manipulation.

Key highlights:

1. Clean and maintainable code structure: I refactored repeated logic into reusable functions (e.g., displayMessage, updateScore, resetStyle) to ensure DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

2. Magic numbers and hard-coded values were extracted into constants, making the app easier to update or scale later.

3. Uses both function declarations and arrow functions appropriately to balance readability and modern JS syntax.

4. Demonstrates dynamic styling and layout changes using DOM API (e.g., changing background color and element width upon success).

5. Clean UI feedback loop: inputs are validated, and meaningful messages guide the user through the game.
